# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎯 CRITICAL FIXES & ADMIN ENHANCEMENTS COMPLETE: Fixed critical route ordering bug and implemented comprehensive admin user management. BACKEND: 1) CRITICAL FIX - Moved /orders/my-orders route BEFORE /orders/{order_id} to prevent 404 errors when React Native app calls /orders/my-orders (was being matched as order_id='my-orders'), 2) Created AdminUserUpdate Pydantic model with optional fields: name, email, phone, password, 3) Implemented PATCH /api/admin/update-user/{user_id} endpoint with admin-only access, email/phone uniqueness validation, password hashing, and selective field updates. FRONTEND: 1) Added Edit buttons to all user tabs (Customers, Vendors, Riders) in AdminDashboard, 2) Created comprehensive Edit User Dialog with form fields for name, email, phone, and password (optional), 3) Implemented handleEditUser and handleUpdateUser functions with smart change detection - only sends modified fields to backend, 4) Added proper validation and user feedback with toast notifications, 5) Dialog shows user type and ID for context. ADMIN NOW HAS FULL USER MANAGEMENT: View all users by role, edit credentials, manage wallets, monitor deliveries, and track system-wide statistics. Backend restarted successfully. Ready for testing."

    message: "✅ ROUTE OPTIMIZATION TESTING COMPLETE: Comprehensive testing of route optimization functionality completed successfully. TESTED ENDPOINTS: 1) POST /api/vendor/optimize-routes - Successfully generates optimized delivery routes using haversine distance calculations, properly clusters orders by proximity, returns structured response with route details (rider_index, order_ids, total_distance_km, estimated_duration_minutes). 2) POST /api/vendor/batch-assign-riders - Successfully assigns riders to optimized routes, updates orders with rider_id, delivery_sequence (1,2,3...), and status='out-for-delivery'. VERIFICATION: Tested with real Mumbai coordinates (Bandra, Andheri, Powai, Goregaon, Malad, Juhu, Versova, Lokhandwala), verified distance calculations (14.25km, 3.25km), confirmed delivery sequence numbering, validated order status updates. BACKEND LOGS: Only minor bcrypt version warnings, no critical errors during route optimization. All route optimization features are working correctly and ready for production use."

    message: "🎉 CRITICAL BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL PRIORITY FIXES VERIFIED: ✅ PRIORITY 1 - CRITICAL ROUTE FIX: GET /api/orders/my-orders now returns 200 OK (not 404) and successfully retrieves customer orders with proper JWT authentication. Route ordering fix is working perfectly - /orders/my-orders appears before /orders/{order_id} preventing path collision. Both endpoints function correctly. ✅ PRIORITY 2 - ADMIN USER MANAGEMENT: PATCH /api/admin/update-user/{user_id} endpoint fully functional with comprehensive testing: name updates, email/phone uniqueness validation (proper 400 errors), password updates with hashing verification, multiple field updates, admin-only access control (403 for non-admins), returns user data without password field. ✅ EXISTING ADMIN ENDPOINTS: All verified working - GET /admin/customers, /admin/vendors, /admin/riders, /admin/stats, POST /admin/add-wallet-money. Backend is production-ready with all critical fixes implemented and tested."
